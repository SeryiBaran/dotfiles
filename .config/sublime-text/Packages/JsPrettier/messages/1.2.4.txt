## 1.2.4

Release Date: 2017-02-16

- Added support for the new `jsxBracketSameLine` option. When
  `jsxBracketSameLine` is true (the default is false), right-angle brackets ">"
  of multi-line jsx elements will be placed at the end of the last line, instead
  of being alone on the next line. You may be required to update to the latest
  version of the Prettier to leverage the `jsxBracketSameLine` option
  (available since v0.17.0).
