## 1.3.0

Release Date: 2017-02-18

- Added the new setting `allow_inline_formatting` (defaults to `false`) which
  provides the ability to format "selections" of in-lined JavaScript code,
  outside of the normal JavaScript syntax. For example, to format a selection of
  JavaScript code within a PHP or HTML file. When `true`, the JsPrettier command
  is available for use across all Sublime Text syntaxes.
