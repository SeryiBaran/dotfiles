## 1.25.0

Release Date: 2019-02-27

- Enabling debug mode now also sets Prettier's "--loglevel" option to "debug"
  (when not overridden by "additional_cli_args"), for printing additional debug
  information to the console.

  For more information on Prettier's CLI log level option(s),
  see <https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html#loglevel>.
