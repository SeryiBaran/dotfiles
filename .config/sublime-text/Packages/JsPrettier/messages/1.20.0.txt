## 1.20.0

Release Date: 2018-02-13

- Added new `auto_format_on_save_requires_prettier_config` setting that will
  enable/disable auto format on save *only* if a Prettier config file is (or isn't) found.

  The Prettier config file is resolved by first checking if a `--config </path/to/prettier/config>`
  is specified in the `additional_cli_args` setting, then by searching the
  location of the file being formatted, and finally navigating up the file tree
  until a config file is (or isn't) found.
